                        <h3>Why is structured data important for SEO?</h3>
                        <p>Structured data (Schema.org markup) helps search engines understand your content better,
                            which can lead to rich snippets in search results, better visibility, and higher
                            click-through rates. It's essential for AEO and helps your content appear in featured
                            snippets and answer boxes.</p>

                        <h3>How long does it take for SEO to show results?</h3>
                        <p>SEO results typically start showing after 3-6 months of consistent optimization work.
                            However, technical SEO improvements and structured data implementation can show faster
                            results, sometimes within 2-4 weeks. AEO optimization can also provide quicker visibility in
                            answer engines.</p>
